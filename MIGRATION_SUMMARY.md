# Migration Summary: API Keys from Frontend

## What Changed

The system has been refactored to pass API keys from the frontend side panel instead of loading them from backend `.env` files.

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Clean up .env file

**Before restarting the backend, you MUST clean up your `.env` file!**

The error you're seeing is because the old API key fields are still in your `.env` file, but they're no longer defined in the Settings model.

### Quick Fix

Remove or comment out these lines from your `.env` file:
```bash
# OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-...
# ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
# N8N_DEFAULT_URL=http://...
# N8N_DEFAULT_API_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5...
```

### Automated Cleanup (Recommended)

Run the cleanup script to automatically remove old API key fields:
```bash
cd backend
python cleanup_env.py
```

This script will:
- Create a backup of your current `.env` file
- Remove all old API key fields
- Add explanatory comments
- Show you exactly what was removed

See `backend/CLEANUP_ENV.md` for detailed manual instructions.

## Files Modified

### Backend
- `backend/app/core/config.py` - Removed API key loading from environment
- `backend/app/models/chat.py` - Added API key fields to request model
- `backend/app/services/ai_service.py` - Modified to receive API keys as parameters
- `backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/chat.py` - Updated to pass API keys to AI service
- `backend/env.example` - Removed API keys, added explanatory comments

### Frontend
- `sidepanel/sidepanel.js` - Updated to send API keys with requests

### Documentation
- `backend/README_API_KEYS.md` - Detailed architecture explanation
- `backend/test_api_keys.py` - Test script for new architecture
- `backend/CLEANUP_ENV.md` - Instructions for cleaning up .env file
- `backend/cleanup_env.py` - Automated cleanup script

## Migration Steps

1. **Clean up `.env` file** (use `python cleanup_env.py` or manual cleanup)
2. **Stop the backend service**
3. **Restart the backend service**
4. **Configure API keys in the side panel settings**
5. **Test the new functionality**

## Benefits

- ✅ Better security (no API keys in backend files)
- ✅ User control over their own API keys
- ✅ No need to modify backend for different users
- ✅ Cleaner separation of concerns

## Testing

Run the test script to verify the new architecture:
```bash
cd backend
python test_api_keys.py
```

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. **First, check that you cleaned up the `.env` file**
2. Check that API keys are configured in the side panel
3. Verify backend is running and accessible
4. Check browser console for error messages
5. Review the detailed README in `backend/README_API_KEYS.md`
6. Check `backend/CLEANUP_ENV.md` for .env cleanup instructions
7. Use `python cleanup_env.py` for automated cleanup
